## Koa blog api.

My koa v2 blog api project. It's still in alpha and uses libs contained in [my
koa userapi app]('https://github.com/maotora/koa-userapi').

But has more routes, tests and models.

##Usage.

Typical node.js app using koa framework.

1. Clone repo 

        git clone https://github.com/maotora/koa-blogapi.git

2. Change director and install packages.

        cd koa-blogapi && npm install

3. Transpile & watch ES2015 files before starting up the server.

        npm run watch

4. You can now start the server and run tests.

        npm run start

    In other terminal

        npm run test

5. Do a Migle Dance & Come give me a star! *It helps. *
